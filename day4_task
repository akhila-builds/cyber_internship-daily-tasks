To configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows and Linux systems in order to understand how network traffic filtering works and how firewalls enhance system security.

Tools Used
Windows Defender Firewall (Windows 10/11)

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu Linux

Part A: Linux Firewall Configuration Using UFW
1. Check Firewall Status
Command:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status verbose
If inactive:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw enable
2. List Current Rules
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status numbered
This displays all active firewall rules.

3. Block Inbound Traffic on Port 23 (Telnet)
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw deny 23
Verify:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
Expected Output:
Port 23 should show as DENY.

4. Test the Block Rule
bash
Copy code
telnet localhost 23
Expected Result:
Connection refused or blocked.

This confirms the firewall rule is working.

5. Allow SSH (Port 22)
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw allow 22
Verify:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
Port 22 should show as ALLOW.

6. Remove Test Rule
bash
Copy code
sudo ufw delete deny 23
Confirm removal:

bash
Copy code
sudo ufw status
Part B: Windows Firewall Configuration
1. Open Firewall Settings
Control Panel
→ Windows Defender Firewall
→ Advanced Settings

2. View Existing Rules
Select:

Inbound Rules

Outbound Rules

Review active entries.

3. Create Rule to Block Port 23
Steps:

Click Inbound Rules

Select New Rule

Choose Port

Select TCP

Enter specific local port: 23

Select Block the connection

Apply to Domain, Private, and Public

Name the rule: Block Telnet Port 23

Finish setup.

4. Test the Rule
Open Command Prompt:

nginx
Copy code
telnet localhost 23
Expected Result:
Connection fails.

5. Remove the Rule
Delete the created rule from Inbound Rules list.

How Firewalls Filter Traffic
A firewall evaluates traffic based on:

Source IP address

Destination IP address

Port number

Protocol (TCP/UDP)

Connection state

If traffic matches an allow rule, it is permitted.
If traffic matches a deny rule or no rule, it is blocked.

Most modern operating system firewalls are stateful, meaning they track active connections and allow return traffic automatically.

Key Concepts
What is a Firewall?
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined rules.

Difference Between Stateful and Stateless Firewall
Stateless Firewall:

Inspects packets individually

Does not track session state

Stateful Firewall:

Tracks active sessions

Makes decisions based on connection context

More secure and intelligent

Inbound vs Outbound Rules
Inbound Rules:
Control traffic entering the system.

Outbound Rules:
Control traffic leaving the system.

Why Block Port 23 (Telnet)?
Telnet:

Sends data in plaintext

No encryption

Vulnerable to credential interception

Secure alternative:
SSH (Port 22)

How UFW Simplifies Firewall Management
UFW provides a simplified command interface for managing complex iptables rules.
It reduces configuration errors and makes rule management easier.

Common Firewall Mistakes
Blocking SSH and losing remote access

Leaving unnecessary ports open

Forgetting to test rules

Misconfigured rule priority

Not removing temporary rules

What is NAT in Firewalls?
Network Address Translation (NAT) allows multiple internal devices to share a single public IP address. It hides internal IP addresses and adds a layer of protection.

Learning Outcome
Through this task, I:

Configured firewall rules to allow and block traffic

Tested rule effectiveness using local connection attempts

Understood inbound and outbound filtering

Gained practical experience with firewall management tools

Learned how firewalls reduce attack surface

This task strengthened foundational network security and traffic filtering knowledge.
