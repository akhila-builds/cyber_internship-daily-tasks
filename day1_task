Network Port Scanning using Nmap
This project demonstrates basic network reconnaissance by scanning a local network to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services.
The task helps in understanding network exposure and potential security risks.Objective


Tools Used: Nmap (Port scanning and service discovery)

Network Information
Local IP Range: 192.168.1.0/24
Scan Type: TCP SYN Scan
Scan Command Used
nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24


result:


Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.5
PORT     STATE SERVICE
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds

 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers
1. What is an open port?
An open port is a network port that is actively listening and accepting incoming
connections from other systems.

2. How does Nmap perform a TCP SYN scan?
Nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port. A SYN-ACK response indicates the port
is open, while an RST response indicates it is closed.

3. What risks are associated with open ports?
Unauthorized access, service exploitation, information leakage, and malware entry.

4. Difference between TCP and UDP scanning?
TCP scanning is connection-oriented and more reliable, while UDP scanning is
connectionless and slower with less reliable responses.

5. How can open ports be secured?
By closing unused ports, using firewalls, enabling authentication, and keeping
services updated.

6. What is a firewall’s role?
A firewall controls traffic by allowing or blocking access to ports based on rules.

7. Why do attackers perform port scans?
To identify open services and plan attacks.

8. How does Wireshark help?
It captures network packets and helps analyze TCP handshake and scan behavior.
