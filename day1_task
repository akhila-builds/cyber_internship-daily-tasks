Network Port Scanning using Nmap
This project demonstrates basic network reconnaissance by scanning a local network to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services. The task helps in understanding network exposure and potential security risks.Objective
To discover open ports on devices within a local network and analyze associated security risks.

Tools Used: Nmap (Port scanning and service discovery)

Network Information
Local IP Range: 192.168.1.0/24
Scan Type: TCP SYN Scan
