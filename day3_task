This project demonstrates a basic vulnerability assessment performed on a local machine using a free vulnerability scanning tool. The objective was to identify security weaknesses, analyze their severity, and recommend remediation steps.

Tool Used: Nessus Essentials
Scan Target: 127.0.0.1 (Localhost)
Scan Type: Full System Scan
Scan Duration: ~45 minutes

Methodology
Installed Nessus Essentials.

Updated vulnerability database plugins.

Configured scan target as localhost (127.0.0.1).

Performed a full vulnerability scan.

Analyzed vulnerabilities based on severity and CVSS score.

Researched remediation strategies for high and critical issues.

Documented findings and recommendations.

Scan Summary
Severity	Count
Critical	1
High	3
Medium	6
Low	9
Informational	14

Critical and High-Risk Findings
1. Outdated Software Detected (High Severity)
Description:
Multiple applications were running outdated versions with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.

Risk:
Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) and privilege escalation.

CVSS Score: 8.8 (High)

Remediation:

Update all affected software to the latest stable version.

Enable automatic update mechanisms.

2. SMB Signing Not Enforced (Medium/High)
Description:
Server Message Block (SMB) signing was not required.

Risk:
Susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Remediation:

Enable SMB signing via system security policies.

Disable SMBv1 protocol if enabled.

3. Open Ports Exposing Services
Detected Open Ports:

445 (SMB)

135 (RPC)

Risk:
Increases attack surface and allows enumeration by attackers.

Remediation:

Disable unnecessary services.

Configure firewall rules to restrict access.

Close unused ports.

4. Weak TLS Configuration
Description:
TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols were enabled.

Risk:
Vulnerable to downgrade and cryptographic attacks.

Remediation:

Disable TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1.

Enforce TLS 1.2 or higher.

Risk Prioritization Approach
Vulnerabilities were prioritized based on:

CVSS score

Exploit availability

Network exposure

Potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability

Key Concepts
What is Vulnerability Scanning?
Vulnerability scanning is an automated process used to detect known security weaknesses in systems, networks, or applications.

Vulnerability Scanning vs Penetration Testing
Vulnerability Scanning:

Automated

Identifies known vulnerabilities

Broad coverage

Penetration Testing:

Manual and automated

Attempts to exploit vulnerabilities

Simulates real-world attacks

Common PC Vulnerabilities
Outdated operating systems

Unpatched software

Open ports and exposed services

Weak encryption protocols

Misconfigured system settings

What is CVSS?
CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized framework used to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities. Scores range from 0 to 10.

Severity Levels:

0.0–3.9: Low

4.0–6.9: Medium

7.0–8.9: High

9.0–10: Critical

What is a False Positive?
A false positive occurs when a vulnerability scanner incorrectly reports a vulnerability that does not actually exist.

How to Prioritize Vulnerabilities
Address Critical and High severity issues first.

Consider exploit availability.

Evaluate business or system impact.

Fix externally exposed services before internal ones.

Remediation Summary
Updated outdated applications.

Disabled legacy protocols.

Closed unnecessary open ports.

Strengthened local firewall configuration.

Enabled automatic patch management.

Conclusion
This assessment provided practical exposure to vulnerability scanning tools and risk evaluation. The exercise improved understanding of:

Automated vulnerability detection

CVSS-based risk scoring

System hardening techniques

Basic remediation planning

Regular vulnerability scanning is essential to maintain system security posture and reduce exposure to known threats.
